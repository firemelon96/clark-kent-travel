During your island-hopping tour, you will visit Cowrie Island, Luli Island, and Pambato Reef, all of which are excellent swimming and snorkeling spots. Cowrie Island is a popular destination for a buffet meal prepared by boatmen or tour operators. It has cabanas with massage areas and a beautiful view of the ocean. You can also order beer or cocktails from the bar while you relax in the sun.Luli Island is a sandbar that emerges only at low tide. It is surrounded by mangroves and has a lagoon where you may swim and a diving board where you can jump into the blue waters. Meanwhile, Pambato Reef is notable for its diverse population of coral reefs and fish.",
